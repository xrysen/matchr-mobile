# Matchr Mobile

## Introduction:
Matchr Mobile is the mobile version of [Matchr](https://github.com/xrysen/matcher) created with React-Native and Javascript. It relies on the Express server found in the previously linked repo.

Inspired by Tinder, Matchr will allow two people to swipe left or right on local restaurants until a match is found for both, cementing dinner plans for the evening!

Right now the user is hardcoded, but could be easily updated to retreive info from a database.

It has also only been tested on an Android emulator, but due to it being created in React-Native, it should also work on iOS
